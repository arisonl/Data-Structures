    "The sorting principle of quick sort is as follows: Pick a partitioning (aka pivot) element. For example use the last element of the list, `list[-1]`, as the pivot. Then run through the list and every time you find an element smaller than the pivot, place it in the sublist that holds the smaller items. Every time you find an element larger than the pivot, place it at the sublist with the larger items. Now these two sublists can be sorted independently. Sort them recursively. The main difference between merge sort and quick sort is that merge sort runs independenetly of the input data, it just halves the list. Quick sort partitions it based on a selected element.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to execute this algorithm. The first and more intuitive version, creates two lists and then concatenates them. This version is more readable, but it is not as space efficient as it uses additional lists. Note that this implementation is consistent to recursive return pattern 1 with a tail recursion."

    "A more efficient implementation creates the two sublists in place (space complexity `O(logN)`). It uses a left index which starts from `list[0]` and a right index which starts from the element left left of the pivot, `list[-2]`. The left index runs the list to the right and every time it finds an element larger than the pivot it stops. The right index runs the list to the left and every time it finds an element smaller than the pivot is stops. The two elements are swapped and the process goes on until the two indices meet. The point at which they meet is the position where the pivot must be placed. The pivot is swapped with this element and now the list consists of two sublists: The one on the left of the pivot contains the smaller than the pivot elements and the one on the right of the pivot contains the larger than the pivot elements. Assorting the sublists is done here by the helper function `partition()`.\n"
