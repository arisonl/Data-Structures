    "For a list of 5 items, `i` will start from 0 and will go up to 3 (not 4). This is why the outer loop goes up to `size-1` (with `in range(size==5)`, Python would get you up to 4). When the outer loop `i=1`, the inner loop will check items `j=2` to `j=4`. The inner loop always remains to the right of `i`. For this, for a 5 items list, `i` needs to go up to 3, to avoid a comparison of item at 4 with itself (which may cause unwanted swaps)."

    "### Comparison and Conclusion\n",
    "Both algorithms are **`O(N^2)`**. Insertion sort performs better the closer an input list is to being sorted. At the extreme that the input list is already sorted, insertion sort becomes **`O(n)`**. Here is the reason: The outer loop executes the same way for both algoriths. However, insertion sort needs only to span as many items as needed in order to find the right position (none, if the input list is already sorted, in which case the complexity relaxes to `O(n)` due to the outer loop), while selection sort needs always span the entire remaining list to locate the next minimum item."
